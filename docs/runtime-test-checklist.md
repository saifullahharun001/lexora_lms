# Lexora LMS Runtime Test Checklist

## Test Environment

- Environment: Local Ubuntu VM
- Server IP: 192.168.197.130
- API via Nginx: http://192.168.197.130/api/v1
- Direct API Port: 4000 bound to 127.0.0.1 only
- Process Manager: PM2
- Reverse Proxy: Nginx
- Database: PostgreSQL

## 1. Deployment / Runtime Checks

- [x] PM2 process `lexora-api` online
- [x] API health works from VM through direct localhost port
- [x] API health works from VM through Nginx
- [x] API health works from Windows host through Nginx
- [x] Direct `192.168.197.130:4000` access blocked from Windows host
- [ ] PM2 survives reboot
- [ ] Nginx survives reboot
- [ ] PostgreSQL survives reboot

### Deployment Test Notes

- API was initially reachable from Windows host through direct port `4000`.
- API binding was changed from all interfaces to localhost-only:
  - From: `*:4000`
  - To: `127.0.0.1:4000`
- After the fix:
  - VM internal direct API access works through `localhost:4000`.
  - Nginx reverse proxy works through port `80`.
  - Windows host can access the API through Nginx.
  - Windows host cannot directly access `192.168.197.130:4000`.
- Deployment hardening change was committed with:
  - Commit: `46a4eaf`
  - Message: `Bind API server to localhost for reverse proxy hardening`

## 2. Auth Checks

- [x] Test department `LAW` created in database
- [x] Register student user
- [x] Email verification token generated
- [x] Verify email
- [x] Login user
- [x] Receive access token
- [x] Receive refresh token/session
- [x] Refresh token works
- [x] Logout works
- [x] Invalid password rejected
- [x] Repeated failed login attempt tracked

### Auth Test Notes

- Test department inserted manually into `departments` table:
  - `id`: `dept_law_test`
  - `code`: `LAW`
  - `slug`: `law`
  - `name`: `Department of Law`
- Runtime test user:
  - Email: `runtime-test-student@cu.ac.bd`
  - Status after verification: `ACTIVE`
- Do not store raw access tokens, refresh tokens, or email verification tokens in documentation.
- Failed login attempt was recorded in `login_attempts` with:
  - `outcome`: `FAILURE`
  - `failure_reason`: `invalid_credentials`
- Successful login attempt was also recorded with:
  - `outcome`: `SUCCESS`
- Malformed refresh token behavior needs improvement:
  - Current behavior found during testing: `InternalServerError`
  - Expected behavior: `400 Bad Request` or `401 Unauthorized`
- Access tokens are short-lived.
- During testing, an expired access token caused `401 Unauthorized`.
- For protected endpoint testing, always use a freshly generated access token.
- Login response currently returns:
  - `accessToken`
  - `refreshToken`
  - `refreshTokenExpiresAt`
  - `twoFactor` status
- 2FA status during runtime test:
  - `enabled`: `false`
  - `required`: `false`
  - `availableMethods`: `[]`

## 3. Authorization / Department Isolation

- [x] Protected endpoint rejects unauthenticated request
- [x] Authenticated user can access own allowed resources
- [ ] Student cannot access another student’s data
- [ ] Teacher cannot access unassigned course data
- [ ] Admin cannot access another department’s data
- [x] Policy guard works on sensitive endpoints

### Authorization Test Notes

- `GET /api/v1/programs` without token returned `401 Unauthorized`.
- Initially, the logged-in runtime test user had no roles/permissions.
- The same endpoint with a valid token but no required policy returned `403 Forbidden`.
- Policy guard returned: `Access denied by policy`.
- Runtime database initially had no seeded RBAC data:
  - `permissions`: `0`
  - `roles`: `0`
  - `user_roles`: `0`
- A temporary runtime role was created for testing:
  - Role ID: `role_law_department_admin`
  - Role code: `department_admin`
  - Role name: `Runtime Department Admin`
  - Department: `dept_law_test`
- Runtime test user was assigned the temporary `department_admin` role.
- Fresh login returned:
  - `roles`: `["department_admin"]`
  - `permissions`: `[]`
- `department_admin` uses static policies from the authorization service, including:
  - `identity-access.*`
  - `department-config.*`
  - `course-management.*`
  - `enrollment.*`
  - `attendance.*`
  - `assignment.*`
  - `submission.*`
  - `quiz.*`
  - `attempt.*`
  - `result-processing.*`
  - `transcript-verification.*`
  - `notification.*`
  - `audit-compliance.*`
  - `file-storage.*`
  - `reporting-dashboard.*`
  - `system-configuration.*`
- AuthorizationService supports:
  - Direct policy match
  - Wildcard match such as `*`
  - Prefix-style match such as `course-management.*`
- `department_admin` role works because static role policies include module-level wildcard policies.
- `Authenticated user can access own allowed resources` is currently verified using the temporary `department_admin` runtime role, not a normal student self-resource flow.
- Student-specific own-resource isolation still needs separate testing.
- Teacher assigned-course isolation still needs separate testing.
- Cross-department admin isolation still needs separate testing.

### Department Context Notes

- Department context header discovered:
  - Header name: `x-department-id`
  - Runtime value used: `dept_law_test`
- DepartmentContextResolver resolves department context from:
  1. Public verification path
  2. Authenticated principal active department
  3. `x-department-id` header
  4. Unresolved fallback
- During testing, a valid token with `department_admin` role still failed at service layer before the request-context fix.
- Error before fix:
  - `Active department context is required`
- After the request-context propagation fix, the same endpoint worked.

### Request Context Bug Notes

- Root cause of request-context bug:
  - AuthGuard set `request.principal`.
  - RequestContextInterceptor initialized a new request context with `principal: null`.
  - AcademicService read principal from RequestContextService.
  - Because the request context principal was null, AcademicService failed with `Active department context is required`.
- Fix:
  - RequestContextInterceptor now initializes `principal` from `request.principal ?? null`.
  - Department context is initialized from `principal.activeDepartmentId` when available.
  - Audit department context is initialized from the resolved department context.
- No AuthGuard, PolicyGuard, department isolation, or authorization logic was changed.
- Request-context fix commit:
  - Commit: `025f8ba`
  - File changed: `apps/api/src/common/request-context/request-context.interceptor.ts`

### Request Context Fix Verification

- Codex/build verification:
  - `pnpm --filter @lexora/api build` passed.
  - `pnpm --filter @lexora/api typecheck` passed.
- Focused propagation check confirmed:
  - `principalActor`: `user_runtime_department_admin`
  - `department.kind`: `department`
  - `department.departmentId`: `dept_law_test`
  - `department.source`: `principal`
  - `auditDepartmentId`: `dept_law_test`
- Live VM verification after fix:
  - Pulled commit `025f8ba`.
  - Built API successfully.
  - Restarted `lexora-api` with PM2.
  - Fresh login returned `roles:["department_admin"]`.
  - `GET /api/v1/programs` with valid token and `x-department-id: dept_law_test` returned `200 OK`.
  - Response was an empty list `[]`, which is expected because no academic programs have been created yet.

## 4. Academic Core

- [ ] Create academic program
- [x] List academic programs
- [ ] Create course
- [ ] List courses
- [ ] Create course offering
- [ ] Assign teacher to course offering
- [ ] Enroll student
- [ ] Validate student course visibility rules

### Academic Core Test Notes

- `GET /api/v1/programs` was tested successfully after the request-context fix.
- The endpoint returned:
  - HTTP status: `200 OK`
  - Response body: `[]`
- This confirms that authenticated department-scoped read access works for the Academic Core list endpoint.
- No academic program has been created yet.
- Next Academic Core test should start with `POST /api/v1/programs`.
- Before creating a program, inspect `create-program.dto.ts` to confirm the required request body.
- Academic Core tests currently depend on temporary runtime test data:
  - `dept_law_test`
  - `runtime-test-student@cu.ac.bd`
  - `department_admin` role assignment

## 5. Assessment

- [ ] Create assignment
- [ ] List assignments
- [ ] Submit assignment
- [ ] Student can only see own submissions
- [ ] Teacher can review assigned course submissions
- [ ] Create quiz
- [ ] Start quiz attempt
- [ ] Submit quiz attempt
- [ ] Validate quiz access rules

## 6. Result Processing

- [ ] Create/configure grade scale
- [ ] Compute result
- [ ] Verify result
- [ ] Publish result
- [ ] Published result becomes locked
- [ ] Direct edit after publish blocked
- [ ] Amendment request created
- [ ] Amendment approved
- [ ] Amendment applied
- [ ] GPA computed
- [ ] CGPA computed

## 7. Transcript Verification

- [ ] Create transcript record
- [ ] Issue transcript version
- [ ] Generate verification token
- [ ] Public verification works
- [ ] Public verification returns safe/minimal data
- [ ] Token expiry respected
- [ ] Revoke transcript/token
- [ ] Revoked transcript fails or shows revoked status

## 8. API Quality Checks

- [ ] Pagination works on list endpoints
- [ ] Invalid DTO rejected with validation error
- [ ] Rate limit works on public transcript verification endpoint
- [ ] Error responses include request ID
- [ ] Sensitive endpoints do not expose excessive data

### API Quality Notes

- Security headers are present in API responses through Nginx/API middleware.
- Error responses currently include structured error objects.
- Some error responses had empty `meta` objects.
- Malformed refresh token handling should be improved to avoid `InternalServerError`.
- Invalid password login returns structured unauthorized response:
  - `code`: `UnauthorizedException`
  - `message`: `Invalid credentials`
- Unauthenticated protected endpoint access returns:
  - `401 Unauthorized`
  - `message`: `Authentication is required`
- Authenticated request without required policy returns:
  - `403 Forbidden`
  - `message`: `Access denied by policy`
- Expired or invalid access token returns:
  - `401 Unauthorized`
  - `message`: `Authentication is required`
